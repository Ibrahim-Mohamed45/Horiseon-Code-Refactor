## Updates made to starter code

* I added semantic HTML elements to the starter code.
* I added alt attribute to images so users of the website are proivided with information about the image if a user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).
* I changed heading attributes so they fall in sequential order.
* I changed title attribute to a descriptive title.
* I fixed the links on the website so they function correctly.
* I consolidated CSS selectors and properties and remove redundtant parts of the CSS starter file.
* I added comments to the CSS file.
* I resized the images so the page will load faster.
